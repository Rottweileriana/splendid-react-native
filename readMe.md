# Welcome to Splendid by Rebecka Ã…berg

This is an app for people to rent out their belongings to others, with an optional delivery service.

 You can go ahead and download the repo and make sure you have Expo installed.

    npm install -g expo-cli

This app currently only works with Android.

# Why?

This was an assignment for KYH Stockholm FE20. The students developed their own app on the theme sustainability, in this case it is on the premise to make it easier for people to rent things they need for a short time instead of buying new stuff and to give those who already have something that they don't need to use all the time an alternative to stashing it were no one uses it.

## The idea in details

The users can rent things from the fellow users and choose to go get the thing by them self or to get an eco-friendly delivery with [the company], pay in different ways e.g. credit/debit card, direct deposit, cash.
If users choose to rent out their things instead, they will have the opportunity to choose the cost of the rent ([the company] will take a percentage), how and when the thing is available for other users.
Both users will have insurance from [the company] to make the platform safe to use for both ends

## Where is the project now?

This app is in Swedish. This project is as of now a front-end only, i.e. no back-end, project. Due to some issues with installing libraries, this app does not have a date-picker in the request for an item to be rented, nor can you choose to upload an image when "creating" a new post. Since there is no back-end, no real manipulation can be done from the user.

## What is left?

What I would like to add if I had more time to put on this project would be:

- Login
- Date-picker
- Image-picker
- FAQ
- Chat
